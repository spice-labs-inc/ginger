# Ginger -- Encrypted Uploader

The code that takes a JWT created by the web site, a public key PEM generated by the web site and
creates an encrypted ZIP file to upload.

This allows a user to ensure that data is encrypted with a specific public key before uploading to Spice Labs'
servers (or other servers).

The code is written in Rust and uses OpenSSL for most of the encryption operations.

## Command line 

*  `-z`, `--zipin` `<ZIPIN>`   The location of the zip file that contains JWT, server, & public key. This avoids having to use the `--jwt`
   `--key`, and `--server` options as these items are stored in a single zip file
*  `-j`, `--jwt` `<JWT>` The JWT to use to communicate/authenticate with the server (if `zipin` provided, that's authoritative)
*  `-k`, `--key` `<KEY>` The file that contains the public key PEM used to encrypt the upload if `zipin` contains the key, this option with be ignored
*  `-s`, `--server` `<SERVER>` The address of the server to post the results to. if `zipin` contains the server, this option with be ignored
*  `-p`, `--payload` `<PAYLOAD>`
          The path to the payload to upload. It can be an individual file or a directory. If it's a directory, the contents will be TARed for upload
*  `-e`, `--encrypt-only` Only encrypt using the key. Do not upload
*  `--uuid` `<UUID>` For encrypt_only operations, provide the uuid that would otherwise be provided by the JWT
*  `--comment-no-sensitive-info` `<COMMENT_NO_SENSITIVE_INFO>` A comment that will be included in plain text in the uploaded bundle. It should not contain sensitive information
*  `-m`, `--mime-type` `<MIME_TYPE>` The mime type of the bundle upload. For Deploy Events `de` will expand to `application/vnd.info.deployevent`. This should be used for Deploy Events. A check will be made that all files with the `.json` extension contain valid deploy event JSON. `gr` and `bt` will expand to `application/vnd.cc.bigtent` The mime type for Artifact Dependency Graph generated by Goat Rodeo (or other ADG creation tools). When this mime type is selected a check will be made that the upload is a directory and that there is at least one `.grc`, `.grd` and `.gri` file
* `--accept-alt-mime-type=true` Uploading bundles should only use `application/vnd.cc.bigtent` or `application/vnd.info.deployevent` mime type. If you want to upload with a different mime type, you must set this flag to `true`.

          Print help
*  -V, --version
          Print version
